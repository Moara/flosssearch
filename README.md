# About FlossSearch.Edu

The FlossSearch.Edu tool was created to support instructors and students in selecting FLOSS projects hosted on GitHub for teaching software engineering. The tool is in English to facilitate its use by researchers from different countries. The project home page is http://191.252.92.63/flosssearch/

Considering the growing diversity of projects available in software repositories, finding those with the desired features for integration in the teaching of Software Engineering is not a trivial task. For this purpose, we identified criteria that have been used for project selection. This set of criteria helped us build this tool to assist instructors and students in searching for open-source projects for their teaching-learning process.

All projects available here are hosted on GitHub. We used the Open Hub to identify the number of lines of code criteria and the GitHub API to implement the scripts used for other criteria. Due to GitHub API's limitations, we developed some scripts and ran them using a set of projects from GitHub but stored the results locally. Therefore, it is worth mentioning that when you run 
FlossSearch, you will be referring to our local database and not getting real-time information directly from GitHub, although we update this information about the projects constantly.
