# FlossSearch.Edu

Through FlossSearch.Edu we seek to assist teachers in the process of choosing open source projects hosted in GitHub used in software engineering education.

Considering that there is a growing diversity of projects available in software repositories, finding those that have the desired features for integration in the teaching of Software Engineering is not a trivial task. For this purpose, we identified criteria that have been used for project selection and and with this set of criteria helped us to built this tool to assist teachers search for open source projects to be used in their teaching-learning process.


All projects available here are hosted on GitHub website. We used the Open Hub to identify the number of lines of code criteria, and the GitHub API to implement the scripts used for other criteria. Due to GitHub API's limitations, we developed some scripts and ran them using a set of projects from GitHub, but stored the results locally. Therefore, it is worth to mention that when you run Floss Search, you will be referring to our local Database and not getting real-time information directly from GitHub although we update this information about the projects constantly.
